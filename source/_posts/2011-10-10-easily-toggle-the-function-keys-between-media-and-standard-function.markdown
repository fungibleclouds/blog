Tired of having to open system preferences/keyboard to toggle the default behavior of functions keys? Use this AppleScript with [Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com/) or [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) to easily toggle the function keys between media and standard role."
{% include_code togglefn.applescript %}


Similarly, use this app-toggler AppleScript to toggle between Chrome and TextMate.

{% include_code app-toggler.applescript %}

Now just assign a hotkey to the script file and the hotkey becomes a toggle button.
