[Anesidora extension](http://code.google.com/p/pandora-extension/downloads/detail?name=Anesidora-1.3.2.crx) for Chrome lets you play [cloud music](http://www.pandora.com) without opening a flash tab in Chrome.

This nifty controller lets you manage Pandora from a small drop-down window while reducing the performance hit that often accompanies Flash-based apps.
